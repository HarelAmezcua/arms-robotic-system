# Robotic Collision Avoidance using Graph of Convex Sets (GCS)

This repository implements a robotic motion planning system using the **Graph of Convex Sets (GCS)** for **collision-free trajectory optimization**. It leverages recent advances in convex relaxation and optimization to generate smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible paths in cluttered environments.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Convex relaxation of motion planning using GCS
- 🦾 Support for multi-DOF robotic arms (URDF-based models)
- 📦 Obstacle representation via convex decomposition or bounding volumes
- 🔄 Real-time replanning support (optional)
- 📈 Visualization tools for planned trajectories and feasible sets
- 🔍 Benchmarking tools for comparing with other planners (RRT, CHOMP, etc.)

## 📚 Background

Traditional sampling-based planners struggle with guarantees on optimality and feasibility. GCS offers an alternative by formulating the trajectory planning problem as a **convex optimization over a graph**, where each node represents a convex region of the configuration or workspace, and edges correspond to feasible transitions.

This formulation enables:
- Global reasoning over possible paths
- Efficient solving using convex optimization
- Handling of kinematic constraints and obstacle avoidance in a unified framework

This project is inspired by and extends the work presented in:
> Dai, H., & Tedrake, R. (2019). *Trajectory planning for aggressive maneuvers using a convex optimization-based approach*. ICRA.  
> Marcucci, T., et al. (2021). *Motion planning using the graph of convex sets*. arXiv preprint.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) (for GCS and geometry tools)
- `pydrake`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `cvxpy`
- Optional: `mosek` (for faster solving)

### 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gcs-collision-avoidance.git
cd gcs-collision-avoidance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🤖 Launch a Demo

```bash
python demo_planar_arm.py
```

This will:
- Load a simple 2D robot arm
- Build a convex graph of its workspace
- Solve for a collision-free path
- Visualize the result

## 📊 Evaluation

Benchmarks available in `benchmarks/` compare GCS against RRT* and CHOMP in:
- Success rate in cluttered environments
- Planning time
- Path optimality (e.g., length, smoothness)
